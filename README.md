
Welcome to the BlackJack game!
This is the first program I've ever made

Future Tasks:

1. Save the player's name, and use it throughout the app.
2. Ask the player if he wants to play again, rather than just exiting. (done)
3. Save not just the card value, but also the suit.
4. Use multiple decks to prevent against card counting players. (done)
